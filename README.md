## About this project

Scribbly is a web application that provides a platform for users to create and manage their digital journal. With Scribbly, users can easily jot down their thoughts, experiences, and ideas, and organize them in a personal and customizable journal.

- **Digital Journaling**: Users can create and store their journal entries online, eliminating the need for physical notebooks or papers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Scribbly offers a clean and intuitive user interface, powered by Radix UI and Shadcn/UI components, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with their journal.
- **Secure and Private**: Scribbly prioritizes user data security and privacy, ensuring that journal entries are kept confidential and protected.
- **Subscription Plan**: Scribbly offers a monthly subscription plan that provides users with additional features and benefits.
- **Reminder Feature**: The reminder feature is a valuable addition to Scribbly. By sending reminder emails to users who have activated this option every day at 9 pm, you help users stay consistent with their journaling habit and make it a part of their daily routine.
